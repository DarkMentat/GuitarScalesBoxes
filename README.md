Knowledge of various scales and modes is a very useful skill for the guitarist. It can help in learning the different riffs or melodies as most of them are built on some scale or mode and if you know them the fingers will be focused at the proper positions themselves. It can help to percept a melody by ear as you first hear a sound of any scale or mode and then it will help to recreate the music. It can also help you to improvise and compose music because you would imagine the final mood and sound, and knowing modes and scales you will construct phrases on the suitable scales and modes for this sounding.
